#Scrape Folder
The "scrape" folder in this project is a directory that contains all the code and resources related to web scraping. Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites by sending HTTP requests, parsing the HTML content, and extracting the desired information.

In the "scrape" folder, you will find the following files and directories:

1. scrape.py: This is the main Python script responsible for performing the web scraping tasks. It may contain functions or classes that handle the scraping logic, such as sending requests, parsing HTML, and extracting data.

2. utils.py: This file contains utility functions or helper methods that are used by the main "scrape.py" script. These functions can include common operations like handling HTTP requests, parsing URLs, or formatting data.

3. data: This directory is used to store the scraped data. It may contain subdirectories or files depending on the structure of the data being scraped. For example, if you are scraping multiple websites, you might create separate subdirectories for each website to organize the data.

4. config.py: This file contains configuration settings or variables that are used by the scraping script. It can include parameters like the target website URL, the user agent to be used in requests, or any other settings specific to the scraping process.

5. requirements.txt: This file lists all the Python packages and their versions required for running the scraping script. It ensures that the necessary dependencies are installed before executing the code.

The "scrape" folder is a common convention used to organize web scraping code and resources in a project. It helps to keep the scraping-related files separate from other parts of the project, making it easier to maintain and understand the codebase.
